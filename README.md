# Deploy a high-availability web app using CloudFormation

As your final project, you'll be faced with a real scenario

Creating this project will give you the hands-on experience you need to confidently talk about infrastructure as code. We have chosen a realistic scenario where you will deploy a dummy application (a sample JavaScript or HTML file) to the Apache Web Server running on an EC2 instance

There will be two parts to this project:

- **Diagram**: You'll first develop a diagram that you can present as part of your portfolio and as a visual aid to understand the CloudFormation script

- **Script** (Template and Parameters): The second part is to interpret the instructions and create a matching CloudFormation script

## Starter Code

You will find starter code for the project in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/udacity/nd9991-c2-Infrastructure-as-Code-v1). The same repo has the resources used in the lesson demos/exercises for a quick reference

## Scenario

Your company is creating an Instagram clone called Udagram

Developers want to deploy a new application to the AWS infrastructure

You have been tasked with provisioning the required infrastructure and deploying a dummy application, along with the necessary supporting software

This needs to be automated so that the infrastructure can be discarded as soon as the testing team finishes their tests and gathers their results

_Optional_ - To add more challenge to the project, once the project is completed, you can try deploying sample website files located in a public S3 Bucket to the Apache Web Server running on an EC2 instance. Though, it is not the part of the project rubric
